**This project needs your help!** Please help to improve this application and
fork the repository on `GitHub. <https://github.com/benediktschmitt/emsm>`_

Bug reports

When you found a bug, please create a
`bug report <https://github.com/benediktschmitt/emsm/issues>`_.

If you know how to fix the bug, you're welcome to send a *pull request.*

Code
----

If you like the EMSM and want to contribute to the code, then do it :)

Note, that commits should never go directly to the *master* branch.

Plugins
-------

**You wrote a new plugin and want to share it? Great!** Write me about it on
GitHub and I will add it to the plugins list.

To simplify the usage by other users, you could prepare your plugin:

#.  Choose a short and unique name for your plugin.
#.  Create a :mod:`plugin package <emsm.plugins.plugins>`, that contains the
    source file and data, which comes with your plugin.
#.  Add a small `reST <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ docstring to your plugin.
    If you don't know how to do this, you can take a look at the source code
    of some other plugins. It's quite easy.

    The documentation should contain at least these sections:

    * About (What does your plugin?)
    * Download URL
    * Configuration
    * Arguments

Spelling Mistakes
-----------------

I guess the source code and this documentation contain a lot of spelling
mistakes. Please help to reduce them.
