What are core plugins?
----------------------

The core plugins work as *frontend* of the EMSM. Without them, the application
would be useless. 

A managed server needs also backup and control mechanisms to make sure that 
everything is running safe. Thus, plugins like :mod:`guard` or :mod:`initd` are
also core plugins.
