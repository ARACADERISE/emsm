What are EMSM plugins?
----------------------

The EMSM plugins work as *frontend* for the EMSM and automate minecraft server
tasks.

How to write a plugin
---------------------

It's very easy to create your own plugin.

*   Read the :mod:`~emsm.plugins.hellodolly` tutorial for a quick introduction.
*   If you want to know more and you're fit in Python, I suggest you read the
    source code of the EMSM for a full overview. I guess this will not take more
    than 1h of your time. Simply start with the :file:`__init__.py` module
    and follow the calls.
